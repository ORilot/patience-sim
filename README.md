# patience-sim
A simulation of the card game patience - also called solitaire.\
It is intended to produce some data on why you win/lose and whether there is some correlation.\
Originally not intended to have a visual aspect, but might need one in order to debug and test code.

## Early predictions:
You lose because your aces get stuck.\
You lose because pairs of cards get stuck e.g., 5 of hearts and 5 of diamonds.\
You win because you get all aces early.
